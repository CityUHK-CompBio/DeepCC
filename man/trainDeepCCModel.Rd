\arguments{
\item{trainData}{a data.frame containing functional spectra of training data (each row presents one sample)}

\item{trainLabels}{a character vector containing lables of training data}

\item{hiddenLayers}{a numeric vector containing hidden layers architecture}

\item{gups}{a integer indicating how many GPUs used in parallel computing using GPUs (defaut = 0)}
}
\value{
a trained DeepCC model
}
\description{
This function trains DeepCC Model on the training data.
}
